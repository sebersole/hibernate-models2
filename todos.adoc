== Cached member annotations

Annotations targeting members to cache and make accessible from declaring class -

* @Id
* @EmbeddedId
* @Version
* @TenantId
* @PrePersist, @PostPersist, ...
* @
* @
* @
* @


== Open Questions

* Hierarchical packages?  E.g. should things defined on the `com.acme` package apply to things in the `com.acme.model` package?  Should `PackageDetails` have reference to its "parent" `PackageDetails`?
* Allow <mapped-superclass/> in dynamic models?
* Support for `@Comment`
* `@LazyGroup` in XSD?
* `@ListIndexBase` in XSD?
* `@Mutability` in XSD?
* `@OnDelete`
* `@Parent`
* `@PartitionKey`
* `@RowId`
* `@SecondaryRow`
* `@SQLInsert`, `@SQLUpdate` and `@SQLDelete` for secondary tables in XSD
* `@SoftDelete`
* `@Struct`
* `@TenantId`
* `@TimeZoneStorage`
* `@TimeZoneColumn`
* `@CreationTimestamp`
* `@UpdateTimestamp`
* `@View`
* generated values


== XML Annotations

List of annotations I've come across as needing, mainly for dynamic models, which do not make general sense -

* `@Abstract`
* `@Extends`
* `@CollectionClassification`
* `@Target`[1]


[1] org.hibernate.annotations.Target does exist, but is deprecated.  Can either repurpose that one or create a new one along with these others.
